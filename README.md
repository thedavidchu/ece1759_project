# On-Line Miss-Rate Curves

This repository analyzes the performance of on-line miss-rate curve (MRC)
generation algorithms.

## Historic Notes

Originally, this was my project repository for my ECE1759
(Advances in Operating Systems) Final Project.

Originally, I was going to write it in Rust. Then, I realized I would be much
too slow at writing Rust.
